# Predicting Mortality in Patients with Necrotizing Fasciitis: A Machine Learning Study

This is a Jupyter notebook of my final project for my certificate program in data science. Entitled "Predicting Mortality in Patients with Necrotizing Fasciitis: A Machine Learning Study," the project fits unsupervised and supervised learning models to clinical data from patients diagnosed with necrotizing fasciitis and related disorders.
